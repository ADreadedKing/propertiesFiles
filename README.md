# Euphoria Patches Properties Files
Welcome to the community-driven block.property files!
## How to contribute
- A Pull Request can be opened and the changes will be merged with Euphoria Patches.
- The raw property file can also be shared on [discord](https://discord.gg/5N45SAsC3X) for those who have not worked with GitHub before
## Template
At the top of each property file, there is a template on how new entries should look like
## Version
- Each property file has an independent version system which increases when a vanilla component has been changed, it does not increase when the community has added modded entries
- The properties files will always be up-to-date with the Euphoria Patches dev versions
